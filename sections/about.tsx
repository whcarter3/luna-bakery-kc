    title: 'Why Sourdough?',
    text: `Sourdough is the oldest bread method in the world! The fermentation process creates natural, wild yeasts that adapt to the air and environment around them. As a result, all sourdough starters are unique in bacterial content, and the resulting yeast naturally leavens the bread. Sourdough naturally  has a lower glycemic load, a lower gluten content, and higher probiotic content than instant yeast bread.`,

    title: 'Ingredients',
    text: `All Luna sourdough loaves are made with a mixture of high protein bread flour, whole wheat flour, and rye flour. We source organic, non-gmo grains to maximize the benefits and make all loaves the old fashioned way with flour, kosher salt, and water. Thatâ€™s it. There are no additives, preservatives, or hidden ingredients, just 3 ingredients!`,
  },
  {
    title: 'The Process',
    text: `All loaves are made from a naturally leavened sourdough starter that is maintained on a twice daily basis. They are hand mixed in small batches in our home kitchen to ensure each loaf gets the time and attention it needs over the 18-24 hour fermentation period. The resulting loaf stays fresh for an extended period of time and has a unique, delicious, hearty taste.`,
